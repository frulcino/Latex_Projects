abstract = {The state of the art of optimal flows at the end of 1978 is reviewed. The different aspects of the problem statement are established in the most complete way possible; then methods for the solution of the static optimization are presented and filed, with a brief description of the most typical ones, trying to show the respective merits of each family, and with a discussion of points of special interest. Finally, dynamic aspects with applications to online dispatch are investigated.}
